00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,200
Alright! Let me take you now to makerchip.com.

1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,189
And I'll open up the integrated development environment by clicking here.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,495
Makerchip is an evolving platform, so it's possible that it may look different for you.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,761
I'll open an example so we have something to look at.

4
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:27,187
You'll find various examples here, along with a number of tutorials that you should feel free to run through anytime, to either reinforce a concept you're having trouble with,

5
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:30,470
or to go beyond what we cover in this course.

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:37,423
I'll open up this long division example. This circuit performs division similar to how you would do long division on paper.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,263
I'm not going to focus on the circuit, but rather on the features of Makerchip.

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,956
The long division design is now in our editor pane, where we can edit our circuit model.

9
00:00:46,956 --> 00:00:53,129
 This is written in transaction level Verilog; compilation happened automatically when I opened the example.

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,785
But we would compile our design from this e-menu or using Control + Enter.

11
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:05,268
I'll recompile and you'll see spinners on the tabs while the model is compiling and simulating.

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,328
We can see the log output in the log tab.

13
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:15,774
It's important to always check your logs first every time you compile and fix any errors and unexpected warnings.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,228
Many errors are non-fatal and you'll still be able to compile and simulate,

15
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,623
but it's much easier to debug errors from the log than to debug your simulation.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,207
I'm going to split panes and place the log tab down, here so I can always keep an eye on it.

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:47,028
So, we've now got a logic diagram of our circuit here and simulation has generated waveforms, which show us the values on all the signals essentially the wires in our circuit for the duration of the circuit simulation.

18
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:52,999
I'm going to again split panes so I can see the waveform and the logic diagram at the same time.

19
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:55,514
Let me put the waveforms down here.

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:05,840
These various views are linked. We can click this signal here, for example, and it will highlight in the circuit diagram.

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:16,788
It also highlights in this NAV TLV tab. This tab shows our code similar to the editor, but this is a representation of our code as interpreted by the tools.

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,294
You'll use this version of your code to debug your designs.

23
00:02:21,294 --> 00:02:27,146
Errors and warnings will be highlighted in this code, corresponding to some of the errors you'll see in the logs.

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,632
So, the general debug flow is to use your waveform to track down incorrect simulation behavior,

25
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:38,207
and then you'll trace the signal back through the logic diagram and code and fix the issue.

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,485
Note that you can hover over logic in the diagram to see the logic expressions.

27
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:50,062
Also note that you can jump from a NAV TLV line to the editor by clicking on the line number.

28
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:55,250
So, you can track from the incorrect simulation behavior back to the faulty source code.

29
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,994
There's also a VIZ tab, which will further simplify debug for large designs.

30
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:02,875
We'll talk about that one later.

31
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:10,240
We'll take a look at a few other things in the IDE later as well, but this is everything you'll need to get started.
